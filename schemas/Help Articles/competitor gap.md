slug: competitor gap

### Case Study
### The Challenge
A marketing agency noticed competitors appearing in AI answers while they remained invisible. Their competitor gap was a lack of structured citations and schema freshness.

### Our Approach
We audited their schema, added missing reviews and FAQ files, and implemented an AI sitemap ping schedule. Within weeks, Claude and Gemini started referencing their brand.

### Outcome
- AI mentions ↑ 38%.
- Client inquiries ↑ 27%.
- Improved trust in AI summaries.
