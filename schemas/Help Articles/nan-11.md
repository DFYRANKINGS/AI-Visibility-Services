### Guide
### The Basics
JSON vs YAML are the two main formats AI models read for structured data. Both are valid, but their use depends on the project and repository setup.

### When to Use Each
- JSON: Best for automated systems and APIs.
- YAML: Better for readability and manual updates.
- Always host both to maximize AI compatibility.

### Best Practice
Provide dual formats in your AI sitemap so assistants never miss critical information.
