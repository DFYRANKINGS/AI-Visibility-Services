### Understanding AI Overviews
AI overviews summarize online information directly in Google’s results, often replacing the need for users to click. Businesses missing from these summaries lose major visibility.

### Why You Might Be Left Out
- No structured data or AI sitemap.
- Outdated services or missing reviews.
- Inconsistent NAP (name, address, phone) across directories.

### What You Can Do
Ensure your business has complete schema coverage and a well-maintained AI sitemap so you’re eligible for inclusion in AI overviews.
