### What Is AI Pinging?
AI pinging is the process of alerting AI engines that new structured data is available to crawl. Without it, updates may go unnoticed for weeks.

### How to Ping AIs
- Use tools like Curl, GitHub Actions, or automation APIs.
- Submit updated sitemaps to Google, Bing, and AI endpoints.
- Include last-modified timestamps in your AI sitemap.

### Why It’s Crucial
Proactive AI pinging speeds up index updates and helps assistants trust that your brand’s data is always current.
