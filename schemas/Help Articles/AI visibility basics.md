### Guide
### What Is AI Visibility?
AI visibility is how often AI models recognize and recommend your brand in conversational answers. It’s the next evolution of search ranking.

### How to Improve It
- Maintain verified schema and AI sitemaps.
- Include FAQs and reviews in structured formats.
- Keep data refreshed and aligned with your website.
- Request verification or inclusion on trusted repos.

### Why It Matters
High AI visibility means you’re cited, trusted, and featured in voice and assistant search — long before a user clicks a link.
