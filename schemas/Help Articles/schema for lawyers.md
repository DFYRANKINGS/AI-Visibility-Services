### Why Schema Matters for Attorneys
Schema for lawyers allows AI assistants to verify your practice areas, licenses, and reviews. Without it, you risk being excluded from legal queries.

### Implementation Steps
- Use LegalService schema with bar license details.
- Add review and FAQ schema covering common questions.
- Publish JSON and YAML versions in your AI repository.
- Submit the AI sitemap to search and AI engines.

### Outcome
Proper schema for lawyers builds AI authority and drives qualified client inquiries from assistant-based search.
