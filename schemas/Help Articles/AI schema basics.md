### Guide
### Why Schema Matters in AI Search
AI schema basics define how AIs understand your website. Schema helps assistants like ChatGPT and Gemini recognize what your business does, where it’s located, and how it’s reviewed.

### Getting Started
- Add Organization, Service, and LocalBusiness schema.
- Include JSON and YAML formats for AI accessibility.
- Connect all files through an AI sitemap.

### The Benefit
When you implement AI schema basics properly, AI search engines see your business as credible and contextually relevant — paving the way for citations and recommendations.
