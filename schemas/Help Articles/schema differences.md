### Guide
### Understanding the Formats
Schema differences exist mainly in syntax and use cases. JSON-LD is modern and preferred for AI, while Microdata and RDFa embed directly in HTML.

### Key Comparisons
- JSON-LD: Easier to update, AI-friendly.
- Microdata: Inline with content but harder to maintain.
- RDFa: Semantic, often used in academic contexts.

### Best Practice
Use JSON-LD for AI visibility—it’s cleaner, modular, and machine-readable.
