### Guide
### How AI and SEO Differ
AI vs SEO isn’t a replacement argument — it’s an evolution. SEO ranks pages for human queries; AI visibility ranks facts, entities, and verified data for machines.

### What to Focus On
- Continue classic SEO for long-tail human searches.
- Layer in structured data (JSON, YAML).
- Submit AI sitemaps and maintain LLM.txt.
- Track citations, not just backlinks.

### The Takeaway
Combining AI vs SEO strategies ensures visibility across both algorithmic and conversational search ecosystems.
