### Guide
### Understanding AI Assistants
AI assistants like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity analyze structured data rather than just keywords. They read JSON, YAML, and FAQ schemas to decide which brands look reliable enough to cite.

### Key Factors They Consider
- Schema Accuracy: Well-formatted Organization and Service schemas.
- Review Consistency: Recent, verifiable customer feedback.
- Transparency: Licenses, pricing details, and team info in machine-readable formats.
- Freshness: Updated files and AI sitemaps.

### Improving Your Chances
Keep your AI-facing data clean, current, and complete. Over time, AI assistants will surface you more often as a trusted answer.
