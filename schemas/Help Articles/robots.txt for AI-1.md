### Guide
### Why Robots.txt Still Matters
Robots.txt for AI tells both search engines and assistants what they can read. Incorrect rules can block your structured data from indexing.

### Best Practices
- Allow JSON, YAML, and FAQ folders.
- Disallow only private or test files.
- Keep a clear sitemap reference at the end.

### Extra Tip
Combine robots.txt for AI with an LLM.txt file to explicitly invite large language models to your verified data.
