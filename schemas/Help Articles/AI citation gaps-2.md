### Guide
### What Is an AI Citation Gap?
An AI citation gap happens when competitors are cited by AI assistants and you aren’t. It’s usually caused by missing structured data or outdated repositories.

### How to Close the Gap
1. Audit existing schema files. 2. Add FAQ and Review schemas. 3. Update AI sitemaps to remove empty entries. 4. Ping search APIs after updates. 5. Repeat quarterly.

### Result
When your AI citation profile is clean and consistent, assistants can verify you and list you as a trusted reference.
