### Guide
### Purpose of an AI Sitemap
The AI sitemap function is to tell AI models where to find your verified data. Unlike a standard XML sitemap, it lists JSON, YAML, and FAQ files that machines parse directly.

### Key Components
- Links to organization, service, review, and FAQ data.
- Timestamps for freshness signals.
- Public hosting on GitHub Pages or similar repos.

### Maintenance Tips
Validate your AI sitemap function monthly and remove dead links to maintain trust with search assistants.
