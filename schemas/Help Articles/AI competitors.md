### What’s Happening
AI competitors are those already optimized for machine readability — meaning their structured data is cleaner and more current than yours.

### Why It Matters
AIs like Gemini or Claude prefer verified data. If competitors refresh their schema more often, they get chosen first.

### How to Respond
- Audit your schema monthly.
- Add fresh reviews.
- Fix outdated links in your AI sitemap.
- Track your competitor mentions using AI engines.

Staying ahead of AI competitors means consistent data accuracy and proactive updates.
