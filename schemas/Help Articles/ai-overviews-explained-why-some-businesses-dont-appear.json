Businesses missing from these summaries lose major visibility.\n\n### Why You Might Be Left Out\n- No structured data or AI sitemap.\n- Outdated services or missing reviews.\n- Inconsistent NAP (name, address, phone) across directories.\n\n### What You Can Do\nEnsure your business has complete schema coverage and a well-maintained AI sitemap so you’re eligible for inclusion in AI overviews."
