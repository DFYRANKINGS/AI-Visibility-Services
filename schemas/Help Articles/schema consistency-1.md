### Guide
### Why Consistency Matters
Schema consistency ensures that every instance of your business information—across JSON, YAML, and website data—matches perfectly.

### How to Maintain
- Centralize data in one authoritative repository.
- Automate synchronization between formats.
- Audit fields like business name, phone, and address quarterly.

### Result
Strong schema consistency builds AI trust and prevents confusion that causes assistants to skip or mis-cite your brand.
