### Guide
### Understanding the Process
The AI citations process involves AI assistants pulling data from verified and structured sources. They use your schema and AI sitemap to confirm your credibility.

### Step-by-Step
1. Publish Organization, Service, and Review schema.
2. Host JSON/YAML files in a public repository.
3. Link them in an AI sitemap.
4. Keep files refreshed to maintain accuracy.

### Why It Works
When assistants can cross-verify consistent data, your brand becomes a reliable source cited in AI responses across ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity.
