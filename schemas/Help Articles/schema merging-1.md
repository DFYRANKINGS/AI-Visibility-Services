### Guide
### Why Merge Schema Files
Schema merging combines multiple related data sets (like locations, services, and reviews) into unified structured files that AI can interpret efficiently.

### Best Practices
- Use consistent keys across all schemas.
- Merge duplicates carefully to avoid conflicts.
- Keep a single authoritative Organization schema.

### Benefit
Consolidated schema merging improves crawl efficiency and reduces confusion across AI models.
