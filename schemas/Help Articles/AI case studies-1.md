### Case Study
### The Situation
A law firm wanted to appear in ChatGPT’s legal results but lacked structured proof of expertise.

### The Approach
We added AI case studies—structured summaries of past cases with schema for outcomes and testimonials.

### The Results
Within a month, the firm gained mentions in ChatGPT and Gemini, improving trust and client inquiries.

Case-based schema remains one of the strongest AI authority boosters for professional services.
