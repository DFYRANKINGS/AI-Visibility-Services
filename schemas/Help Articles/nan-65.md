### What Are Schema Layers?
Schema layers refer to organizing structured data across multiple filesâ€”like core Organization schema linked to individual Service and Review layers.

- Maintain parent-child relationships.
- Reference all layers in your AI sitemap.

### Benefit
Using schema layers clarifies hierarchy, making it easier for assistants to interpret and cite your data.
